# GoTDMS

GoTDMS is a CLI tool written in Go with the primary goal of Reading TDMS Files produced by NI LabVIEW. A lot of the file reading side of this project is based off of the Python project npTDMS (https://github.com/adamreeve/npTDMS)

This project was developed with the goal of being able to get information about TDMS Files residing on Compact RIO's without downloading the files or having to deploy a project to a Compact RIO.
